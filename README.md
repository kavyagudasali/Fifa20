<h1>FIFA 20 Player Analysis</h1>

This project analyzes the attributes of football players in the FIFA 20 dataset to explore player skills, cluster players based on their attributes, and answer specific questions about player demographics, performance, and salaries. The project also includes a comparison of multiple models and a discussion of the challenges faced during analysis.

## Project Structure

### Task 1: Data Analysis
- **Objective:** Prepare a comprehensive data analysis report on the FIFA 20 dataset.
- **Description:** This section includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the players' attributes, focusing on distribution, correlation, and other relevant statistical insights.

### Task 2: Clustering Players
- **Objective:** Cluster football players based on their skill attributes.
- **Description:** Players are grouped into clusters based on their performance metrics using techniques like K-means clustering. The analysis helps to identify different player archetypes and their skill sets.

### Task 3: Specific Data Exploration
- **Objective:** Answer key questions regarding player demographics, performance, and salaries.
- **Questions Explored:**
  1. **Top 10 Countries Producing Footballers:** Identify and rank the top 10 countries with the most players.
  2. **Age vs. Overall Rating Distribution:** Analyze the age at which players tend to stop improving by plotting overall rating against age.
  3. **Salary Comparison of Offensive Players:** Determine which offensive players (striker, right-winger, left-winger) tend to earn the most.

### Model Comparison Report
- **Description:** A detailed comparison of multiple models used for clustering and prediction, including evaluation metrics and recommendations for the best model to use in production.

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Description:** A report detailing the challenges faced during data preprocessing, model selection, and analysis. It includes the reasoning behind the techniques used to address these challenges.

## Dataset
